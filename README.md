# Outlooktool
A production tool for the company Sole Source Technology

This project brought on a multitude of challenges for me as a junior developer. I had to use Microsoft Graph API, which was a very limiting API in terms of calls I could make and recieve data. The challenges I faced were mainly with pagination and getting high amounts of emails to display on the page at 1 time. Microsoft only lets you get multiples of 10's at one given time. So trying to set this application up to see a user's full inbox was challenging. Especially for a company email that mave have thousands of emails at a time.

This was very enjoyable as it was stressfull.

I can't wait to continue to learn more about API's and hopefully easier data to read through then microsoft's in the future.
